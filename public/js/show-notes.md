## Client-side Authentication, Part 1 (7:53)

This two-part series on client-side authentication focuses on how you
can configure your single-page Ember app to query data from the server
using token-based authentication. This first part focuses on basic app
setup/organization, and how to build a username / password form to
retrieve the token from the server.

Part 2 will demonstrate how to use this token to perform queries in
conjunction with Ember Model, as well as how to hack into the Ember
Router to make it possible to recall and retry previously attempted 
transitions.
